# ungoogled-chromium-debian

This repository contains files to build Debian packages of [ungoogled-chromium](//github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium).

This branch contains the code to build packages for: **Debian 9 (stretch)**

## Downloads

**Binaries** (i.e. `.deb` packages): [Get them from the Contributor Binaries website](//ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/).

**Source Code**: Use the tags labeled with `stretch` via `git checkout` (see building instructions). The branches are for development and may not be stable.

## Installing

The packages are essentially identical in structure to Debian's `chromium` packages. At minimum, you will need to install the `ungoogled-chromium` and `ungoogled-chromium-common` packages. For example:

```sh
# dpkg -i ungoogled-chromium_*.deb ungoogled-chromium-comon_*.deb
```

The other packages are as follows:

* `*-driver`: [ChomeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
* `*-l10n`: Localization package for the browser UI.
* `*-sandbox`: [`SUID` Sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/docs/linux_suid_sandbox.md). This is only necessary if you do not have user namespaces enabled (i.e. kernel parameter `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone`)
* `*-shell`: Contains `content_shell`. Mainly for browser development/testing; search [the Chromium docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/docs/) for more details.

## Building

```sh
# Install essential requirements
sudo apt install git python3 packaging-dev

# Setup build tree under build/
mkdir -p build/src
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-debian.git
# Replace TAG_OR_BRANCH_HERE with the tag or branch you want to build
git checkout --recurse-submodules TAG_OR_BRANCH_HERE
cp -r ungoogled-chromium-debian/debian build/src/
cd build/src

# Final setup steps for debian/ directory
./debian/rules setup-debian

# Install remaining requirements to build Chromium
sudo mk-build-deps -i debian/control
rm ungoogled-chromium-build-deps_*.deb

# Download and unpack Chromium sources (this will take some time)
./debian/rules setup-local-src

# Start building
dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
```

### Restarting the build

If the build aborts during the last command, it can be restarted with this command:

```sh
dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -nc
```

If it still fails, then try this command (this will clear any intermediate build outputs):

```sh
dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
```

If all else fails, delete the entire build tree and start again.

### Building via source package

*Build via a Debian source package (i.e. `.dsc`, `.orig.tar.xz`, and `.debian.tar.xz`). This is useful for online build services like Launchpad and openSUSE Build Service.*

First, install base requirements: `# apt install packaging-dev python3`

Then, run the following as a regular user:

```sh
# TODO: Re-use instructions from above
debian/rules get-orig-source
debuild -S -sa
```

(`PACKAGE_TYPE_HERE` is the same as above)

Source package files will appear under `build/`

## Developer info

This section contains information for those contributing to ungoogled-chromium-debian.

### First-time setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Add the remote for Debian as `upstream`:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://salsa.debian.org/chromium-team/chromium.git
```

### Pull new changes from Debian

These instructions will pull in changes from Debian's `chromium` package into `debian_stretch`:

```sh
git checkout --recurse-submodules debian_stretch
git pull upstream stretch
# Complete the git merge
git merge debian_buster
# Complete the git merge
# Update patches via instructions below
```

### Pull new changes from ungoogled-chromium

There are two options, which depend on the use case.

1. Update to tag (where `TAG_HERE` is the tag name):

```sh
pushd debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium/
git fetch
git checkout TAG_HERE
popd
# Commit the submodule changes
# Update patches via instructions below
```

2. Update to HEAD of `master` branch:

```sh
git submodule update --remote
# Commit the submodule changes
# Update patches via instructions below
```

### Updating patches

```sh
# Assuming we are using an existing git clone of the ungoogled-chromium repo
ln -s path/to/ungoogled-chromium  debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium
./debian/rules checkout-ungoogled-chromium

./debian/devutils/update_patches.sh merge
source debian/devutils/set_quilt_vars.sh

# Setup Chromium source
mkdir -p build/{src,download_cache}
./debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium/utils/downloads.py retrieve -i debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium/downloads.ini -c build/download_cache
./debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium/utils/downloads.py unpack -i debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium/downloads.ini -c build/download_cache build/src

cd build/src
# Use quilt to refresh patches. See ungoogled-chromium's docs/developing.md section "Updating patches" for more details
quilt pop -a

# Remove all patches introduced by ungoogled-chromium
./debian/devutils/update_patches.sh unmerge
# Ensure debian/patches/series is formatted correctly, e.g. blank lines

# Sanity checking for consistency in series file
./debian/devutils/check_patch_files.sh

# Use git to add changes and commit
```

### Adding a new branch

To add either a primary or secondary branch:

1. Create a new branch that forks off an existing branch with code that is closest to the desired code.
2. Give the branch a name of the format `DISTRO_CODENAME`. For example, Ubuntu 18.10 (cosmic) should have a branch name `ubuntu_cosmic`.
3. Make the necessary changes and commit
4. Submit a Pull Request for your new branch to the branch it is based off of. In the Pull Request, specify the new branch name that should be created. (This is necessary because GitHub doesn't support the creation of branches via PRs)

### Tagging a new version

1. Update the commit or tag version of the ungoogled-chromium repository in `debian/ungoogled-upstream/version.txt` as necessary.
2. Increment the revision in `debian/distro_revision.txt`. However, if the upstream version was changed in Step 1, reset the revision to `1`.
3. Use `git tag` to add a new tag with the name generated from `debian/devutils/print_tag_version.sh`
	* e.g. `git tag -s $(./debian/devutils/print_tag_version.sh)`
	* NOTE: This requires that `debian/ungoogled-upstream/ungoogled-chromium` contains the ungoogled-chromium repo files.

### Contributing

Contribution guidelines are the same as ungoogled-chromium.

Submit PRs to this repository for every packaging type that should be updated.
